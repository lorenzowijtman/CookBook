## Description

Middle Eastern dish of eggs poached in a flavorful tomato sauce with peppers and spices

## Ingredients

- 6 eggs
- 2 cans crushed tomatoes
- 2 bell peppers (red & yellow)
- 1 large onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 tbs paprika powder
- 1 tbs cumin
- 1 tsp chili flakes
- Fresh parsley
- Feta cheese (optional)
- Olive oil
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Bread for serving

## Preparation

1. Dice onion and peppers, mince the garlic
2. Heat olive oil in a large pan and sauté onions until soft (~5 min)
3. Add garlic, peppers, and all spices, cook for another 5 min
4. Pour in crushed tomatoes, reduce heat and let simmer for 15-20 min until slightly thickened
5. Make small wells in the sauce and crack eggs into them
6. Cover and cook for 5-8 min until egg whites are set but yolks are still runny
7. Top with chopped parsley and crumbled feta if using
8. Serve hot with bread for dipping

## Tips

The eggs will continue cooking from the residual heat, so remove from heat when the whites are just set. For a spicier version, add more chili flakes or a diced jalapeño with the peppers.
