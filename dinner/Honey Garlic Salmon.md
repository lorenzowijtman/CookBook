# Honey Garlic Salmon

00:30 hr

## Description

Salmon fillets glazed with a sweet and savory honey garlic sauce

## Ingredients

- 1½ lb skin-on salmon fillets (about 1.5-inch thick)
- ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper (or to taste)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons honey
- ¼ cup water
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed
- 1 tablespoon garlic, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon green onions, finely chopped

## Preparation

1. Season salmon fillets with salt and pepper
2. Make the honey garlic glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, honey, water, cornstarch and lemon juice until cornstarch dissolves. Set aside
3. In a skillet, add garlic and sauté until fragrant over medium heat, about 1 minute
4. Pour in sauce mixture and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring continuously until thickened to desired consistency
5. Cook salmon in the sauce until done to your liking
6. Garnish with chopped green onions before serving

## Tips

The sauce can be made thicker or thinner by adjusting the amount of cornstarch. Watch the salmon carefully while cooking - it's better slightly undercooked than overcooked.
