# Golden Curry

01:30 hr

## Description
Curry with lots of veggies and rice

## Ingredients

- carrots
- cauliflower
- courgette
- corn
- Golden curry block
- paprika (mix red, orange & green)
- coconut milk
- (optional) mushrooms
- (optional) parsley  

## Preparation

1. Boil some rice & boil the cauliflower
2. Chop up carrots and start wokking them, while wokking the carrots (these take about 15/20 min) you can chop up the other veggies
3. When the carrots are almost done you add the mushrooms and wok until ready
4. Add all the other veggies to the wok pan
5. Add 1 block of the golden curry paste into the veggies, mix & wok for 3 min
6. Add the coconut milk, mix and let it simmer for 5-10 min (until the other courgette is soft too)
7. If the curry is too thick, add in a cup of water & mix well
8. Scoop the rice & make a nice half ball of it in the center of the plate, garnish with some parsley and add the curry around it

## Tips
Get the golden curry (mild) block from an asian store, you probably can't find it in a supermarket.
The cauliflower is boiled seperately because wokking cauliflower doesn't work so well, it is added along with the other veggies in step 4.
