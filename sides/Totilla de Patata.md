00:45 hr

## Description

Spanish potatoe omelette ()

## Ingredients

- 5/6 small potatoes
- 4 eggs
- 1 large white onion
- 2 tbs mayo
- bit of salt
- Olive oil

## Preparation

1. Boil the potatoes until soft
2. whisk up the 4 eggs and add some salt to them, about the same amount as you would add to your regular eggs
3. mash up the potatoes but leave them a little bit chunky, we don't want them fully mashed
4. Dice up the onion
5. throw it all together into a bowl with 2 tbs of mayo
6. put some olive oil in a pan and at low heat, put the mix in the pan with a cover on top for about 15 min
7. once the top side has become solid enough, take a plate, put it on top of the pan and flip the pan to put the tortilla on the plate. Then put a little bit of oil again and slide the tortilla back into the pan to cook the other side as well for another 5 min or so at medium heat

## Tips

Whisking up the eggs and adding the salt in advance makes the eggs extra fluffy because the salt has time to settle into the eggs
