# Spanish Grilled Chicken

00:45 hr

## Description

Spanish-style marinated grilled chicken that pairs perfectly with patatas bravas or any other Spanish dish

## Ingredients

- 4-6 chicken thighs (or breast fillets)
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbs olive oil
- 2 tbs paprika powder
- 1 tbs dried oregano
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 lemon (juice and zest)
- Salt & pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Preparation

1. Mix olive oil, minced garlic, paprika, oregano, cumin, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt and pepper in a bowl
2. Add chicken and coat well with the marinade. Let it rest for at least 30 min (or up to 4 hours in the fridge)
3. Heat grill pan or BBQ to medium-high heat
4. Grill chicken for about 6-8 minutes per side (depending on thickness) until cooked through
5. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing
6. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with extra lemon wedges

## Tips

For extra flavor, make a few shallow cuts in the chicken before marinating. If using chicken breast, pound them to even thickness for more consistent cooking. Works great alongside [Patatas Bravas](<Patatas Bravas.md>) and ginger-garlic broccoli.
