## Ingredients

- 6-8 medium potatoes
- 200g bacon, diced
- 200g grated cheese (manchego or mozzarella)

- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 can crushed tomatoes
- 1 tbs olive oil
- Salt & pepper to taste

## Preparation

1. Cut potatoes into 2-3cm cubes and boil until almost tender (~10 min)
2. While potatoes boil, prepare the bravas sauce: saut√© minced garlic in olive oil, add paprika and chili powder, then add crushed tomatoes. Simmer for 10 min until thickened
3. Drain potatoes and let them dry for a few minutes
4. In a large pan, fry the bacon until almost crispy
5. Add the potatoes to the bacon pan and fry until golden and crispy (~15 min)
6. Pour the bravas sauce over the potatoes and bacon
7. Top with grated cheese and place under the grill/broiler for 2-3 minutes until cheese is melted and bubbly

## Tips

For extra crispiness, you can fry the potatoes in two batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. The traditional bravas sauce can be made spicier by adding more chili powder to taste.
